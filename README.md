## Story
### Weatherapplet to many may seem like a stupid app, but to me, it means the whole world.

In September of 2021, i created this app as a asignment from CS, but it would change how i programmed forever, as it inspired me to create beatshape, astroup, and many more projects.

Nearly 1 Year later, i managed to recover it, i had no words whatsoever.

Thank you to everyone who insired me to code, and enjoy the source!
