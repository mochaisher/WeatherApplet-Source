## Story:
Its september of 2021, I had an assignment in Computer Science that would be a mock-up of an actual weather app, I decided to actually create the app, because of the fact that I was bored during class, it took me around 3 days and a lot of tinkering, but I would end up creating the app, marking the beginnning of all my CS shenanigans.

After creating this app, I started working on Beatshape, since I finally learned how to work with API's, and i would eventually finish Beatshape thanks to this weather applet, the UI of this applet also inspired the UI Design for NExT, which is kinda cool.

Fun Fact: after my teacher saw this, he told me that I should pursue CS as a career, and thanks to him, im now doing that and starting to make my dreams come true, so, if you see this, i want to say from the bottom of my heart, **thank you**.
